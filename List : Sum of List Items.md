## Register No.: 212224040089
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

a=[1,6,4,7,8,9,5,3]
b=0
for i in a:
    b+=i
print(b)
~~~

## Output
![sum of list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d96e1a49-44e4-4036-a4b9-e9a2753f1af7)

## Result
Thus the program has been executed successfully.
