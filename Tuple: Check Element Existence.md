# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence
## Name: GEETHU R
## Register No.: 212224040089
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
tuplex = input()
print("n" in tuplex)
print("8" in tuplex)
~~~

## Output
![element existence](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cdb496c-f5c9-4650-9806-2fb5ce4f7cf2)


## Result
Thus the program has been executed successfully.
